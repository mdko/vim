To create own syntax files, put them in here (~/.vim/syntax),
then start using them:

	:w ~/.vim/syntax/c.vim
	:set syntax=mine


To add to an existing syntax file, create a directory called
'after/syntax' and write to a file with the same name as the
original syntax file you're trying to append to:

	mkdir -p ~/.vim/after/syntax
	:w ~/.vim/after/syntax/c.vim
